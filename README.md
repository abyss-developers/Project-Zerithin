# Project: Zerithin
Project: Zerithin was one of AbyssDEV's experiments on a graphic novel typed game. It is VERY undone, with rough sketches, missing sprites, and more. It was intended to be a test, and for a school experiment for one of the developers. We decided to put this open source to see how long we've come as a game development group, and to show that everyone makes mistakes when started.
## How do I play?
- Click [here](https://github.com/abyss-developers/Project-Zerithin/releases), and choose the operating system you are using. After installation, unzip it with 7zip or WinRAR (or your OS's native zipping program) and navigate the folders until you find **ProjectZerithin.exe** for Windows, **ProjectZerithin.py** for Linux, and for Mac, drag the unzipped **ProjectZerithin.app** folder into the Applications folder on your computer.
## Requirements
